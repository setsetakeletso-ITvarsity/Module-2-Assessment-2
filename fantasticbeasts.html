                <p>10-12 PG ADVENTURE 2h23m</p>
                <p><b>Actors:</b> Eddie Redmayne, Jude Law, Ezra Miller, Dan Fogler</p>
                <p><b>Director:</b> David Yates</p>
                <p>In Bhutan 1932, Newt Scamander helps a Qilin — a magical creature that can see into one's soul as well as the future — give birth. Gellert Grindelwald's acolytes, led by Credence Barebone, attack and kill the mother, and kidnap the newborn. Grindelwald subsequently kills the creature to harness its ability of precognition. Unbeknownst to them, however, the Qilin has given birth twins, the younger of which Newt is able to save.

                    Unable to battle against Grindelwald due to a blood pact, Albus Dumbledore recruits Newt, his brother Theseus, Ilvermorny Charms professor Eulalie "Lally" Hicks, Senegalese-French wizard Yusuf Kama, and American No-Maj Jacob Kowalski to thwart Grindelwald's plan for world domination. Yusuf Kama is tagged as a spy in Grindelwald's inner circle while the rest of the group is sent to Berlin, Germany. There, the group witness Grindelwald being acquitted of all criminal charges by the International Confederation of Wizards (ICW), and subsequently running for the office of Supreme Mugwump. The ICW believes arresting Grindelwald could gain him more support but beating him in a legitimate election will lose him support.
                    
                    Grindelwald's acolytes, who have undermined the German Ministry of Magic, arrest Theseus and plan to assassinate one of Grindelwald's competitors, the Brazilian candidate, Vicência Santos. Dumbledore gives Newt and Lally their next assignments: to rescue Theseus and foil the assassination. While Newt rescues his brother from the secret German wizarding prison, Lally and Jacob thwart the assassination attempt; however, Jacob is subsequently framed for attempting to kill Grindelwald and he and Lally barely escape, giving Grindelwald an incentive to turn the Wizarding world against the Muggle world. Meanwhile, Grindelwald has sent Credence to assassinate Dumbledore. Dumbledore quickly defeats Credence and he is revealed to be the illegitimate son of Dumbledore's younger brother, Aberforth. Learning who his father is and being spared by Albus, Credence starts to question his loyalty to Grindelwald</p>
